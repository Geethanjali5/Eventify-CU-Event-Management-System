# Eventify: Event Management System 
## Query 1:
### 1. Multi-Table Join with Aggregation and Conditions: Highest Revenue per Organizer

This query calculates the total revenue generated by each organizer from ticket fees for their events. It uses multi-table joins between the `organizers`, `events`, and `tickets` tables. The results are grouped by the organizer's name, and ticket fees are summed for each organizer. The query filters organizers with revenue greater than 0 and sorts the results by highest total revenue.

```sql
SELECT o.name AS organizer_name, SUM(t.fee) AS total_revenue
FROM organizers o
JOIN events e ON o.organizer_id = e.organizer_id
JOIN tickets t ON e.event_id = t.event_id
GROUP BY o.name
HAVING SUM(t.fee) > 0
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

#### Detailed Explanation:

1. **`SELECT o.name AS organizer_name, SUM(t.fee) AS total_revenue`:**  
   Selects the organizerâ€™s name and calculates the total revenue for each organizer by summing the ticket fees.

2. **`FROM organizers o`:**  
   Specifies the `organizers` table, assigning it an alias (`o`) for easy reference.

3. **`JOIN events e ON o.organizer_id = e.organizer_id`:**  
   Joins the `events` table with `organizers` based on the matching `organizer_id`, associating events with their organizers.

4. **`JOIN tickets t ON e.event_id = t.event_id`:**  
   Joins the `tickets` table with `events` based on the `event_id`, linking tickets with events.

5. **`GROUP BY o.name`:**  
   Groups the results by organizer name to calculate revenue per organizer.

6. **`HAVING SUM(t.fee) > 0`:**  
   Filters to show only organizers with total revenue greater than 0.

7. **`ORDER BY total_revenue DESC`:**  
   Orders the results in descending order by total revenue, showing the highest revenue first.


## Query 2:
### Event Audience Diversity Index (Cross-Department Participation)

This query calculates the diversity index for each event, which is the number of unique departments that attendees come from. It helps determine how diverse the event's audience is across different departments within the university.

```sql
SELECT e.name AS event_name, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT a.department) AS department_diversity,
       COUNT(a.attendee_id) AS total_attendees
FROM events e
JOIN tickets t ON e.event_id = t.event_id
JOIN attendees a ON t.ticket_id = a.ticket_id
GROUP BY e.name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT a.department) > 1 -- Show only events with attendees from more than one department
ORDER BY department_diversity DESC, total_attendees DESC;
```
#### Detailed Explanation:


1. **`SELECT e.name AS event_name, COUNT(DISTINCT a.department) AS department_diversity, COUNT(a.attendee_id) AS total_attendees`:**  
   Selects the event name, calculates the number of unique departments attendees are from (`COUNT(DISTINCT a.department)`), and counts the total number of attendees for each event.

2. **`FROM events e`:**  
   Specifies the `events` table as the primary source for the query.

3. **`JOIN tickets t ON e.event_id = t.event_id`:**  
   Joins the `tickets` table on the `event_id`, linking tickets to their respective events.

4. **`JOIN attendees a ON t.ticket_id = a.ticket_id`:**  
   Joins the `attendees` table on the `ticket_id`, linking each attendee with the ticket they purchased.

5. **`GROUP BY e.name`:**  
   Groups the results by event name to allow aggregation over each event's attendees and their departments.

6. **`HAVING COUNT(a.attendee_id) > 0`:**  
   Ensures that only events with attendees are included.

7. **`ORDER BY department_diversity DESC, total_attendees DESC`:**  
   Orders the results first by the number of unique departments attending (highest diversity first), and then by total number of attendees in case of ties in diversity.



## Query 3:
### Query: Most Active Attendees

This query identifies the most active attendees, calculating how many events each attendee has attended. It helps analyze the level of engagement among participants by sorting them based on the number of events attended.

```sql
SELECT a.first_name, 
       a.last_name, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT e.event_id) AS events_attended,
FROM attendees a
JOIN tickets t ON a.ticket_id = t.ticket_id
JOIN events e ON t.event_id = e.event_id
GROUP BY a.first_name, a.last_name
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT e.event_id) > 1 -- Consider only attendees who attended more than 1 event
ORDER BY events_attended DESC;

```

#### Detailed Explanation:


1. **`SELECT a.first_name, a.last_name, COUNT(DISTINCT e.event_id) AS events_attended`:**  
   Selects the attendee's first and last names and counts how many unique events they attended.

2. **`FROM attendees a`:**  
   Specifies the `attendees` table as the main data source.

3. **`JOIN tickets t ON a.ticket_id = t.ticket_id`:**  
   Joins the `tickets` table with attendees to link attendees to their tickets.

4. **`JOIN events e ON t.event_id = e.event_id`:**  
   Joins the `events` table with tickets to link tickets to events.

5. **`GROUP BY a.first_name, a.last_name`:**  
   Groups the results by attendee name to calculate event attendance for each individual.

6. **`HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT e.event_id) > 1`:**  
   Filters the results to show only attendees who have attended more than one event.

7. **`ORDER BY events_attended DESC`:**  
   Sorts the results by the number of events attended, showing the most active attendees first.

# Project 2

# 1) Full-Text Search Implementation

## Overview
This section enhances the database schema by adding a **text attribute** with support for **full-text search**. The `reviews` table was introduced to store user reviews for events, utilizing PostgreSQL's full-text search capabilities with `to_tsvector`, `to_tsquery`, and **GIN indexing** for efficient queries.

---

## Schema Changes

### `reviews` Table
The `reviews` table was added to the schema with the following structure:

- **review_id**: A unique identifier for each review.
- **event_id**: A foreign key linking the review to the `events` table.
- **reviewer_name**: The name of the reviewer.
- **review_text**: A column storing document-style text for user reviews.

#### SQL Code:
```sql
CREATE TABLE reviews (
    review_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    event_id INTEGER REFERENCES events(event_id),
    reviewer_name VARCHAR(100),
    review_text TEXT NOT NULL
);
```
### Full-Text Search Setup

To enable full-text search on the `review_text` column, a **GIN index** was created. This optimizes search performance.

### SQL Code:
```sql
CREATE INDEX review_text_idx ON reviews USING GIN (to_tsvector('english', review_text));
```
## Data Population

### Reviews Data
At least **10 meaningful reviews** were added for each event in the `events` table. Below is an example of data added for the event **Journalism Ethics Panel** (`event_id = 6`):

#### Example Data:
```sql
INSERT INTO reviews (event_id, reviewer_name, review_text)
VALUES
(6, 'Alice Johnson', 'The Journalism Ethics Panel was thought-provoking and insightful. The panelists discussed critical topics affecting modern journalism.'),
(6, 'David Brown', 'An engaging session with real-world examples on maintaining ethical standards in journalism.'),
(6, 'Rachel Adams', 'The focus on ethical dilemmas faced by journalists was very informative and eye-opening.'),
(6, 'Tom Carter', 'Loved the discussion on balancing freedom of speech with responsible reporting.'),
(6, 'Julia Kim', 'The panelists shared valuable insights on dealing with misinformation in journalism.'),
(6, 'Liam Wilson', 'An excellent session that highlighted the importance of integrity in journalism.'),
(6, 'Sophia White', 'The Q&A session was interactive and clarified many of my doubts about ethical journalism.'),
(6, 'Emma Davis', 'The examples of case studies discussed during the session were very impactful.'),
(6, 'Noah Scott', 'I appreciated the diversity of opinions and approaches shared by the panelists.'),
(6, 'Mia Collins', 'The panelistsâ€™ depth of knowledge on ethics in journalism was impressive and inspiring.');
```

## Full-Text Search Queries

The following queries demonstrate the use of full-text search on the `review_text` column:

### Query 1: Search for Reviews Containing "journalism"
```sql
SELECT reviewer_name, review_text
FROM reviews
WHERE to_tsvector('english', review_text) @@ to_tsquery('journalism');
```
<img width="1220" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-07 at 2 33 53â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e41254e9-e39c-4755-a79f-29e05a001a98">

## Verify All Reviews for `event_id = 6`

To view all reviews for the event:

### SQL Query:
```sql
SELECT reviewer_name, review_text
FROM reviews
WHERE event_id = 6;
```
<img width="1228" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-07 at 2 34 20â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af280b85-447e-4d3d-81ae-d68a905bcafa">

# 2) Adding an Array Attribute to the Schema

This section describes the addition of an array attribute to the `events` table in the schema. The new array attribute `tags` allows categorizing events using multiple labels.

## Schema Modification

### Adding the `tags` Array Attribute
We added a new column `tags` of type `TEXT[]` to the `events` table to store multiple tags for each event. This was done using the `ALTER TABLE` command:

```sql
ALTER TABLE events
ADD COLUMN tags TEXT[];
```

## Data Population
### Populating the tags Array
The tags array column was populated with meaningful values for all events. Below are some examples of how the data was added:

```sql
UPDATE events
SET tags = ARRAY['career', 'networking']
WHERE event_id = 1;

UPDATE events
SET tags = ARRAY['data science', 'symposium', 'conference']
WHERE event_id = 2;

UPDATE events
SET tags = ARRAY['climate', 'workshop', 'advocacy']
WHERE event_id = 3;

UPDATE events
SET tags = ARRAY['sports', 'competition', 'college']
WHERE event_id = 4;

UPDATE events
SET tags = ARRAY['tech', 'engineering', 'talk']
WHERE event_id = 5;

UPDATE events
SET tags = ARRAY['journalism', 'ethics', 'panel']
WHERE event_id = 6;

UPDATE events
SET tags = ARRAY['business', 'networking', 'mixer']
WHERE event_id = 7;

UPDATE events
SET tags = ARRAY['hackathon', 'engineering', 'competition']
WHERE event_id = 8;

UPDATE events
SET tags = ARRAY['art', 'exhibition', 'student']
WHERE event_id = 9;

UPDATE events
SET tags = ARRAY['coding', 'bootcamp', 'skills']
WHERE event_id = 10;
```

### Queries to Demonstrate Functionality
Query 1: Find Events with a Specific Tag
This query retrieves all events that contain a specific tag (e.g., "networking").

```sql
SELECT name, tags
FROM events
WHERE 'networking' = ANY(tags);
```
### Output:
<img width="404" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-07 at 3 35 20â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f4b798ee-a6bc-45f4-80a1-e31c9c113334">


### Query 2: Find Events with Multiple Tags
This query retrieves events that contain all specified tags (e.g., "networking" and "career").
```sql
SELECT name, tags
FROM events
WHERE tags @> ARRAY['networking', 'career'];
```
### Output:

<img width="487" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-07 at 3 35 36â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75602e17-0059-4903-9a84-65fb6b520c8f">


## Verification
To verify the populated data, run the following query:
```sql
SELECT event_id, name, tags
FROM events;
```
### Output:
<img width="650" alt="Screenshot 2024-12-07 at 3 36 37â€¯PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d52c58ad-b9da-4785-b1ec-521ffe30f40e">

# 3) Creating a SQL Trigger:

We add a boolean column to the tickets table that allows us to know if a ticket has an attendee already.
Our trigger function runs on an insert in the attendees table. Whenever an attendee is added with a foreign
key to our tickets, we can mark the corresponding entry in the tickets table as bought such that we know how
many tickets are bought or still on the market in the tickets table.

```sql
ALTER TABLE tickets ADD COLUMN "bought" BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_tickets_table()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $update_tickets$
   BEGIN
      UPDATE tickets set bought=TRUE
      WHERE tickets.ticket_id=NEW.ticket_id;
      RETURN NEW;
   END;
$update_tickets$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_tickets_table 
AFTER INSERT ON attendees
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE update_tickets_table();
```

## Sample Trigger Event:
For example if we run the query:

```sql
INSERT INTO attendees(attendee_id, uni_id, first_name, last_name, email, department, user_type, ticket_id)
VALUES (1, 'UNI1234', 'John', 'Doe', 'jd1234@columbia.edu', 'CS', 'Student', 5);
```

Then, first the sql engine will insert the row into the attendee table and then execute our trigger for every
row inserted into the attendee table.
The trigger will find the ticket with the ticket_id=5 and update the boolean column 'bought' and set it to True.
